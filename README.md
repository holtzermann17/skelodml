skelodml
========

This is a demonstration of a multi-mode wiki built using
[skelml](https://github.com/petrelharp/skelml).
The main documents are written in LaTeX and will appear
on http://holtzermann17.github.io/skelodml/ -- but the Github-based
wiki is also useful, and is available at https://github.com/holtzermann17/skelodml/wiki

See the Skelml page for instructions on how to update the LaTeX documents.
